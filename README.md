### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bhisma.


An independent who likes to create and share projects about Data Analyst and Machine Learning! I enjoyed Python and Visualizing Data into easy-to-understand information is a fun challenge for me as well as making it a primary language for creating projects. 

Currently I am active as a student at Malang State University and become a freelancer.
